## What?

- Simple form with just two compulsary questions: Link and a Quote from the article that you want to remember
- As simple as it can get. Nothing fancy. Vanilla bootstrap. Vanilla font awesome.
- List public cutouts at profile page
- Share a single cutout with friends and family by emailing it to them
- Share a cutout on social media by copying it's permalink

## Why?

The internet has a lot of good content, blog posts, articles, etc etc. I read a lot
of stuff, and then could not find them again when I wanted to. Pocket is good for saving
for later, Delicious and Pinterest are overkill for something as simple. Hence, this
project!

## Local Setup

**Note:** These steps were tested on a machine running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

- Install `rbenv`
- Install ruby version `2.7.0`
- Install bundler version `2.12.0`
- Run `bundle install`
- [TEST] Run `./bin/rails --version`
  - This ensures that you have the rails gem installed locally

### Creating a local test user

- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Create a user using the `Sign Up` button
- Now, you will be shown a prompt on the home page saying you must confirm your
user by clicking the confirmation link in your email.
- To do this process directly on the database, you can do:
  - Go into the rails console: `zeus console`
  - Get your user: `User.all` or `User.first`
  - Confirm your user: `user.confirm`
- After confirming a user, you should be able to login to your account locally.

A log of the commands to run and their output:

```irb
irb(main):007:0> User.first
  User Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users"  ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
=> #<User id: 1, email: "a@example.com", username: "a1", created_at: "2019-09-14 04:29:01", updated_at: "2019-09-14 04:29:01">
irb(main):009:0> User.first.confirm
  User Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users"  ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
   (0.2ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.7ms)  UPDATE "users" SET "confirmed_at" = ?, "updated_at" = ? WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["confirmed_at", "2019-09-14 04:32:42.534172"], ["updated_at", "2019-09-14 04:32:42.542307"], ["id", 1]]
   (6.1ms)  commit transaction
=> true
```

You can use this process to confirm all locally created users.

## Manual Test Plan

- sign-up
  - confirm a new user using: `User.find(...).confirm`
- login and logout
- login, add a public cutout, check that it is accessible without login, logout
- login, add an unlisted cutout, check that it is accessible without login,
  logout
- login, add a private cutout, ensure that it isn't accessibly without login,
  logout
- edit an cutout's visibility and check if the changes are reflected

## TODO

> In descending order of priority

- [x] Create a good homepage that has a few words about why this project at all
- [ ] User must be able to login with both username as well as email
	- Override devise? (Devise procedure [here][12] seems extremely long)
- [ ] Fix the word limit on quote (50 words?)
- [x] Fix the sign-in and sign-up form UI
- [x] Fix the horrible UI to make it usable at the very least (copy medium, that interface is too good!)
- [x] A system to tag articles (single words)
- [x] A system to search for articles (single search bar, user search, tag search, author search, quote search)
- [x] Ability for users to export their articles into a Markdown file for local storage (A JSON file for import too?)
- [ ] A rating system for self, no sharing as yet
- [ ] Probably friendship and the ability to follow other users
