# cutouts _WIP_ 

> Sign up, and start adding the articles that you have read and want to remember! Deployed [here](http://cutouts.herokuapp.com)

### What?

- Simple form with just two questions : Link and a Quote from the article that you want to remember
- Both fields are compulsary, oft-times I forget what an article is about, a quote
from the article would tell me why the article was good
- As simple as it can get. Nothing fancy. Vanilla bootstrap. Vanilla font awesome.
- WIP

### Why?

The internet has a lot of good content, blog posts, articles, etc etc. I read a lot
of stuff, and then could not find them again when I wanted to. Pocket is good for saving
for later, Delicious and Pinterest are overkill for something as simple. Hence, this 
project!

### TODO (in descending order of priority)

- [x] Create a good homepage that has a few words about why this project at all
- [ ] User must be able to login with both username as well as email
	- Override devise? (Devise procedure [here](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Allow-users-to-sign-in-using-their-username-or-email-address) seems extremely long)
- [ ] Fix the word limit on quote (50 words?)
- [x] Fix the sign-in and sign-up form UI
- [x] Fix the horrible UI to make it usable at the very least (copy medium, that interface is too good!)
- [x] A system to tag articles (single words)
- [x] A system to search for articles (single search bar, user search, tag search, author search, quote search)
- [x] Ability for users to export their articles into a Markdown file for local storage (A JSON file for import too?)
- [ ] A rating system for self, no sharing as yet
- [ ] Probably friendship and the ability to follow other users
