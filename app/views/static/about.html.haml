    %h3
      Cutouts is a web application to bookmark the multitude of articles you read
      online, with the article's author, a quote from the article and some tags
      for classifying articles. Cutouts aims to be a basic web application that
      has none of the bells and whistles of a product like Pinterest which makes
      it's offerings clunky and slow.
